description: Las Olas Venture Capital is a new Florida-based early stage fund that
  invests in startups in a variety of industries. Our mission is to find outstanding
  entrepreneurs in non-obvious places and maximize their impact by connecting them
  to networks of capital, talent, and customers in well-established startup ecosystems.
  We invest in extraordinary people who are building the future. This means technology
  that can redefine existing industries and create new ones. We call these people
  superheroes and transformers. They typically have asymmetrical insight into a particular
  industry and the superpowers for building products that create ascending user networks,
  which as a result drive transformational value.
